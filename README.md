Testing my first blog.
Ever since I first read the [blogging manifesto](https://alexoliveira.cc/essay/blogging-manifesto) and [file over app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app), I've been thinking about setting up a *basic* blog for it. 
So, I'll procrastinate no longer and try to get this to work.

Currently trying:
- no jekyll, only Markdown
- written in Obsidian
- hosting on github pages
- custom domain
