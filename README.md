Testing my first blog.
Ever since I first read the [blogging manifesto](https://alexoliveira.cc/essay/blogging-manifesto) and [file over app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app), I've been thinking about setting up a *basic* blog for it. 
So, I'll procrastinate no longer and try to get this to work.

Currently trying:
- no jekyll, only Markdown
- written in Obsidian
- hosting on github pages

Testing:
- linking: 
	- [[Testing linking]] <- as i guessed this notation is obsidian specific
	- [Testing linkingg](Testing linking.md) <- correct linkage \[\<text\>\]\(\<source\>\)
- images:
	- ![[github-octocat.webp|320]] <- of course it wont work
	- ![|320](github-octocat.webp) <-kinda weird that you need to set the size in the bracket \[| \<size\>\]\(\<link\>\)
