Testing how things work ðŸ”§:
- linking: 
	- [[Testing linking]] <- as i guessed this notation is obsidian specific
	- [Testing linkingg](Testing linking.md) <- correct linkage \[\<text\>\]\(\<source\>\)
- images:
	- ![](github-octocat.webp) <- of course it wont work
	- ![](github-octocat.webp) <-kinda weird that you need to set the size in the bracket \[ \<size\>\]\(\<link\>\)
